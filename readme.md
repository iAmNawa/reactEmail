# React Tac Toe

Creating a tic tac toe game in React.

In particular, we have three components:

Square
Board
Game
The Square component renders a single <button>, the Board renders 9 squares, and the Game component renders a board with some placeholders that weâ€™ll fill in later. None of the components are interactive at this point.
